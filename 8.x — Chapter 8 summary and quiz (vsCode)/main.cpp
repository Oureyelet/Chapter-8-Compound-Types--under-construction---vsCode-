                Question #1
    --------------------------------------*/
    /*
    In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. 
    Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one 
    of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

    Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string), as well as an amount of health 
    that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named printMonster() 
    that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using 
    an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().

    Your program should produce the following output:

    This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
    This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
